    <h2> domanstration of Box model</h2>
    <p>Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a look at the CSS Box Model.
        You'll get an understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.
        In CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the categories of block boxes and inline boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page.
        Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type.</p>

        <div>
            The CSS box model is a concept that describes how every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box by the browser
            1. The box model consists of four parts: content, padding, border, and margin
            Content: This is the actual data in the form of text, images, or other media forms.
            It can be sized using the width and height properties

            Padding: This is the space around the content, inside any defined border. It is transparent and can be set using the padding property

            Border: This is the area between the content and the margin. It covers the content and any padding.
            It can be set using the border property, which allows setting the style, color, and width of the border

            Margin: This is the space around the border. It is transparent and can be set using the margin property. 
            It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors
